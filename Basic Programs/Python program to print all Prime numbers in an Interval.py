# Given two positive integers start and end. 
# The task is to write a Python program to print all Prime numbers in an Interval.

# Definition: 
# A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. 
# The first few prime numbers are {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, â€¦.}.

# The idea to solve this problem is to iterate the val from start to end using a for loop and for every number, 
# if it is greater than 1, check if it divides n. If we find any other number which divides, print that value.

def prime_numbers(x,y):
    my_list = []
    for i in range(x,y):
        if i == 0 or i == 1:
            continue
        else:
            for j in range(2, int(i/2)+1):
                if i % j == 0:
                    break
            else:
